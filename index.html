        <p>Tesla is car company founded by Elon Musk. The company was founded in 2003 in Palo Alto, California. These cars are electric powered rather than diesel powered, this means that they both help the environment and look stylish while doing so. The problem is, these cars have a pricetag of upwards of $70,000. But the good new is, the new model, the Tesla model 3, will be available.
